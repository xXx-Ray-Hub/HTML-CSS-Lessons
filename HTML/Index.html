  <h1 align="center" id="header">How To Avoid Wasting Your Most Valuable Online Asset - TIME!</h1>

  <img src="Images/1-28.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Стикер" align="right" hspace="50" vspace="0">

  <p>If you're involved in an internet marketing business, then
  you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1
  enemy - "Time Wasting".</p>

  <p>What you need to know is that "Time Is Money". And this
  applies even more to the online world, than in regular
  business.</p>

  <p>You see, anyone can become an online entrepreneur. It
  doesn't involve start-up capital or expensive equipment to
  start. A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.</p>

  <p>And since cash isn't really a barrier, time-management has
  become all the more critical. Your challenge for success is
  simply to get more done - in less time.</p>

  <p>So what are the greatest online time wasters and what can
  you do to avoid them?</p>

  <ol>
  <li>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</li>
  <li>Failing to manage your email effectively.</li>
  <li>Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.</li>
  <li>Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</h2>

  <p>This sounds simple. But stop and think how many times you
  retype the same old simple information.</p>

  <p>Most people have cottoned on to automating their email
  signature, but you can go far beyond that when it comes to
  communicating words quickly.</p>

  <p>Get yourself a clickboard or shortcut extender. This will
  enable you to write much faster and prevent you from ever
  having to type the same thing twice.</p>

  <p>I use this utility http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot , but
  there are lots of other useful typing assistant utilities
  available.</p>

  <h2>Failing to manage your email effectively.</h2>

  <p>I know, there's so much spam flying around, but you should
  be attempting to win this war with a few weapons of your
  own installed on your computer.</p>

  <p>i. Make sure you have a working piece of anti-spam software
  set up. Whilst sometimes the wrong messages will get
  trapped, the best software will still remove 98% of the
  emails that you don't want. Make sure they are filtered
  into a junk email file, so you can manually sift
  through them afterwards and pull back any that have
  been incorrectly assumed to be unwanted.</p>

  <p>ii. Set up folders in your inbox and get yourself properly
  organized. I keep a folder for SALES, another one for
  FEEDBACK and others for JOINT VENTURES + many more.</p>
